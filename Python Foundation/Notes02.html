                => 1. Assignment and augmented assignment operators 
                => 2. Multiple Assignment 
                => 3. Arithmentoc operators 
                => 4. Float Division vs Floor Division vs Remainder Division 
                => 5. Boolean Values : True and False 
                => 6. Comparison Operators 
                => 7. Logical Operators 
                => 8. Behavior of logical operators on non-boolean data 
                => 9. Identity Operators 
                => 10. Membership Operators 
                => 11. Behavior of different operators with different data types 
                => 12. Introduction to TypeCasting 
                => 13. Implicit TypeCasting 
                => 14. Explicit TypeCasting 
                => 15. TypeCasting in String datatype 
                => 16. TypeCasting in boolean data type

                1. Assignment and augmented assignment operators 

                       x = 10 
                       x = x * 10 

                       x *= 10 

                2. Multiple Assignment 

                        x = 10 
                        y = 20 

                    x, y, z = 10, 20, 30

                3. Arithmetic Operators 

                        x = 10 
                        y = 5 

                    a = x + y     ==> Adddition
                    b = x - y     ==> Subtraction
                    c = x * y     ==> Multiplication
                    d = x / y     ==> Division
                    

                    print(a)  ==> 15 
                    print(b)  ==> 5
                    print(c)  ==> 50 
                    print(d)  ==> 2.0 float 

                    for division the resultant will always be float 
                    even if u use decimal also for eg : x = 10.1 
                                                        y = 5.2

                                                       d = x/y
                                                     print(d) ==> 15.3

                4. Float Division vs Floor Division vs Remainder Division 

                         5.2  

                         ==> 5.2 is comming between which two numbers 
                              5  and  6 

                              5 is floor 
                              6 is ceiling 

                         6.7 

                         ==> 6.7 is comming between which two numbers 
                                  6 and 7 

                                6 is floor 
                                7 is ceiling  
                           
                     Float Division : 

                           x = 5 
                           y = 2 
                            
                           d = x/y 

                           print(d) ==> 2.5 ==> 2 is floor and 3 is ceiling 

                     Floor Division :
                      
                           x = 5 
                           y = 2 

                           e = x//y 

                           print(e) ==> 2 

                     Remainder Division : 

                           x = 5 
                           y = 2 

                           f = x % y 

                           print(f) ==> 1 

                           x = 10 
                           y = 2
                           
                           g - x % y 

                           print(g) ==> 0 
                           
                           x = 1452
                           y = 10 

                           h = x % y 
                           print(h) ==> 2 

                         when u divide any number by 10 u will get the last digit as a remainder 

                           x = 1563 
                           y = 10      ===> 3  

                     Power : 

                          x = 5
                          y = 2 

                          i = x ** y 
                          print(i) ==> 25



                5. Boolean Values : True and False
                
                        x = True 
                        y = False
                        z = 2 < 5 
                        h = 7 < 5

                        print(y) False 
 
                        print(z) True 

                        print(h) False

                6. Comparision Operators 

                        < 
                        >
                        
                        <= 
                        >= 

                        == 

                        != 

                    x = 12 
                    y = 10

                        print(x == y) False 
                        print(x < y) False
                        print(x > y)  True 
                        print(x <= y) False 
                        print(x >= y) True 
                        print( x != y) True 

                7.   Logical Operators  
                and 8. Behavior of logical operators on non-boolean data 


                         And 
                         Or 
                         Not 

                    Truthy values ==> except 0 any other value is truthy value  
                    Falsy values ==> 0

                     x = True 
                     y = False 

                     AND     ==> and
                    -----------
                    print(x and y) ==> False 
                        
                    True and False ==> False 
                    True and True ==> True
                    False and True ==> False 
                    False and False ==> False 
                    
                    x = 2 < 3 
                    y = 5 < 1 

                    print( x and y ) ==> True and False ==> False 

                ==>  In and operation, 
                     
                        if the first value is truthy , the result is the second value,

                        if the first value is falsy , the result is the first value 

                        Ex :   
                        x = 5 
                        y = 10 
    
                        print(x and y)  ==> 5 

                        print(2 and 3) ==> 3 
                        print(2 and 0) ==> 0
                        print(0 and 2) ==> 0
                        print(0 and 3) ==> 0
                        print(0 and 0) ==> 0 (first zero)

                        print(True and True)  ==> Second True
                        print(True and False) ==> False 
                        print(False and True) ==> False 

                  OR  ==> or operator 
                -----------

                    True or True ==> True 
                    False or True ==> True 
                    True or False ==> True 
                    False or False ==> False 

                 ==> In or Operation, 
                          
                           if the first value is truthy, the result is the first value 
                           if the first value is falsy, we will get the second value 

                      print(True or True) ==> True 
                      print(True or False) ==> True
                      print(False or True) ==> True 
                      print(0 or 3) ==> 3
                      print(0 or 0) ==> 0
                      print(3 or 0) ==> 3 
                      print(3 or 5) ==> 3

                NOT ==> not Operator 
                ------------- 

                    print( not True) ==> False 
                    print( not False) ==> True 
                    print( not 2 < 5 ) ==> False 
                    print( not 2 < 0 ) ==> True
                    
                    print( not 6) ==> False 


              9. Indetity Operators : 

                     is Operator 
                     --------- 

                     a = [1,2,3]
                     b = [1,2,3]

                     print( a is b) ==> False as  a has different reference (memory)
                                               b has different reference

                     b = a 
                     print(a is b) == True as a memory referemce address is assign to b so both has same 
                                      memory address 

                     is not Operator 
                     ---------- 

                     a = [1,2,3]
                     b = a 

                     print(a is not b) ==> False 

                     b = [1,2,3]

                     print(a is not b) ==> True 

                     in Operator 
                     ----------- 

                     a = 'hello'
                     print( 'e' in a) ==> True

                     not in Operator  
                     ------------------
                     
                     a = 'hello'
                     print( 'h' not in a) ==> True
                    
             

              12. Introduction to TypeCasting

                       print(1 + 2.0) ==> here python automotically type cast and gives the output in the form of float 3.0

                       1. Implicit TypeCasting (automatic changes)
                       2. Explicit TypeCasting 

              13. Implicit Type Casting [python itself converted internally]

                          int, float, boolean 
                          
                          int with float 
                          print(1 + 2.0) ==> 3.0 (here first number 1 gets converted into 1.0)

                          int with bool [True as 1 and False as 0 (int)]
                          print(5 + True) ==> 6  (5 + 1)
                          print(5 + False) ==> 5 (5 + 0)
                          print(5 - True) ==> 4 (5 - 4)
                          print(5 - False) ==> 5 (5 - 0)

                          float with bool [True as 1.0 and False as 0.0 (float)]
                          print(5.0 + True) ==> 6.0 (5.0 + 1.0)
                          print(5.0 + False) ==> 5.0 (5.0 + 0.0)

              14. Explicit Type Casting  [we need to convert / change forcefully ]

                          To convert Forecefully into the 

                              int ==> we use int()
                              float ==> float()
                              bool ==> bool()

                         Examples : 

                               print(1 + int(2.0)) ==> 3 (1 + 2)
                               print(float(1)+2.0) ==> 3.0 (1.0 + 2.0)


               15. TypeCasting in String datatype 

                           a = 'M'
                           b = 'U'

                           print(a + b) ==> MU 

                           print('hello' + 1) ==> Error 

                           print("hello" + "Mutyam") ==> helloMutyam 

                           print("hello" + str(True)) ==> helloTrue 

                           print('Mutyam' + str(123)) ==> Mutyam123



               16. TypeCasting in boolean data type

                           print(bool(1)) ==> True 
                           print(bool(-50)) ==> True
                           print(bool(0)) ==> False
