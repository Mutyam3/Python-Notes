                => 2. Reading a file
                => 3. The open() method
                => 4. Modes for opening files
                => 5. Opening a file in ‘r’ mode
                => 6. The file object
                => 7. file object methods
                => 8. The read() method
                => 9. The close method()

                => 11. Opening a file in ‘w’ mode
                => 12. The write() method
                => 13. Writing to a file by opening it in ‘a’(append) mode
                => 14. Opening files safely by using the ‘with’ statement

            ==> 1. File Pathnames  : 
                   ----------------- 

                   File locations 

                   x = 'D:\Python Notes\Python-Notes\Python Foundation\Notes12.html'


            ==> 2. Reading a file : 
                   ----------------- 

                   if it is in same folder we can directly write the file name instead of giving whole path 

                   file = open('users.txt')  // default we have 'r' mode 
                   <!-- print(file) //<_io.TextIOWrapper name="users.txt" mode="r" encoding="cp1252" -->

                   filedata = file.read() 
                   print(filedata) // Bhargav 
                                      Reddy 
                                      Mutyam 

                    file.close() // after reading and writing the file we should safely close the file 
                                    if it is not close, someother person may write some extra code  

            ==> 3. The open() method : 
                   ---------------------- 

                   open('filepathname') 

                   open(file_address, access_mode) 

            ==> 4. Modes for opening files : 
                   -------------------------- 

                   mode = 'r'  ==> for reading the file 
                   mode = 'w'  ==> for writing the file 
                   mode = 'a'  ==> for appending 

                   r: Opens a file for reading only
                   r+: Opens a file for both reading and writing
                   w: Opens a file for writing only
                   w+: Open a file for writing and reading.
                   a: Opens a file for appending
                   a+: Opens a file for both appending and reading

                   file = open('pathname', 'r')
                   file = open('pathname', 'w')
                   

            ==> 5. Opening a file in ‘r’ mode : 
                   ----------------------------- 

                   file = open('pathname', 'r')
                   
                   
            ==> 6. The file object : 
                   -----------------

                   f = open('__file-pathname__', accessmode)

                   here f is the file object created
                   the open keyword returns a file object  

            ==> 7.  File object methods : 
                    --------------------- 

                    
                   close() ==>	Closes the file
                   detach() ==>	Returns the separated raw stream from the buffer
                   fileno()	==> Returns a number that represents the stream, from the operating system's perspective
                   flush()	==> Flushes the internal buffer
                   isatty()	==> Returns whether the file stream is interactive or not
                   read()	==> Returns the file content
                   readable() ==>	Returns whether the file stream can be read or not
                   readline() ==>	Returns one line from the file
                   readlines() ==>	Returns a list of lines from the file
                   seek()	==> Change the file position
                   seekable() ==>	Returns whether the file allows us to change the file position
                   tell()	==> Returns the current file position
                   truncate() ==>	Resizes the file to a specified size
                   writable() ==>  Returns whether the file can be written to or not
                   write()	==> Writes the specified string to the file
                   writelines() ==>	Writes a list of strings to the file

            ==> 8. The read() method : 
                   ------------------- 

                   file = open('users.txt')
                   filedata = file.read()
                   print(filedata) // Mahesh
                                      Bhargav

            ==> 9. The close method() : 
                   -------------------- 

                   file = open('users.txt')
                   filedata = fileread()
                   file.close()


            ==> 10. Writing to a file
            ==> 11. Opening a file in ‘w’ mode
            ==> 12. The write() method
           

                   file = open('users.txt', 'w')
                   file.write('Ramesh')
                   file.close()

                   Here, the problem is it replace the existing text in the file with new text
                   but it is not a problem, in some cases, if we need to replace whole text it would be best to use write() method 
                   if we want to add the new text to the previous text then we do :
                 
            ==> 13. Writing to a file by opening it in ‘a’(append) mode : 
                    ----------------------------------------------------- 

                   file = open('users.txt', 'a')
                   file.write('suresh')
                   file.close()

                   if we run we get the text like this in the file : Rameshsuresh 
                   but it not look nice 

                   file = open('users.txt', 'a')
                   file.write('Ramesh' + '\n') // new line character
                   file.close()

                   file = open('users.txt', 'a')
                   file.write('Mahesh' + '\n') // new line character
                   file.close()

                   output in the file : 
                   -------------------- 
                   Ramesh 
                   Mahesh

            ==> 14. Opening files safely by using the ‘with’ statement : 
                    ---------------------------------------------------- 

                    most of the programmers now using with statement 

                    with open('users.txt') as file:
                    filedata = file.read()
                    print(filedata) // Mahesh
                                       Bhargav 

                    file.read()

                    Here no need to close the file as it automatically done 
                    after coming out of it the file gets closed 

                    If I want to read again it throws an error 

                    with open('users.txt', 'a') as file:
                        file.write('ramu' + '\n')

                    with open('users.txt', 'a') as file:
                        file.write('babu' + '\n')

                    output in the file : 
                    ---------------------
                      ramu 
                      babu 

            ==> Delete a File : 
                ---------------- 

                To delete a file, you must import the OS module, and run its os.remove() function: 

                import os 
                os.remove('filepath')

                check if file was exist or not before deleting the file for to avoid getting an error 

                import os 

                if os.path.exists('filename'):
                    os.remove('filename')
                else:
                    print('file doesnot exist')

                Delete the folder :
                ------------------- 

                import os 
                os.rmdir('foldername')

                Note : You can only remove empty folders.
