                => 10. Type casting user input values 


                   1. Expressions 
                   ----------------- 

                       Expression means it gives some value

                         x = 10   ==> statement ==> Every line we write is an statement 10 is expression
                         print(x) ==> 10 ==> (x) is Expression ==> statement 

                         x = 10       
                         y = 20 
                         print(x + y) ==> 30 ==> Expression 

                         print(2 + 30) ==> Expression

                         23
                         1+2
                         2 < 4
                         5 * 8
                         True and True 
                         2 and 4
                         The above all are expressions which gives some value 

                    2. Arithmetic Expressions 
                    --------------------------

                          x = 10  ==> 10 is expression
                          y = 20  ==> 20 is expression 
                          print(x + y) ==> x + y is Arithmetic Expression print(x+y) is a statement 


                    4. Statements 
                    --------------- 

                         x = 10 is statement 
                         print(x) is statement 

                    5. print() Statement 
                    -------------------------- 
                    
                          print(10)
                          

                    6. end parameter in print() statement 
                    -------------------------------------- 

                          print(10)
                          print(11)
                          print(12)
                          print('hello')

                          output will be 

                          10
                          11
                          12
                          hello 

                          print('hello', end='\n') ==> it's a default behavior of print() statement 
                          after printing hello add end i.e use that \n character which goes to next line 
                          print('hi')

                          output : hello 
                                   hi 

                          print('hello', end = '*') ==> here I am changing the default behavior of print() statement 
                          print('hi') ==> here I am not giving any end character but it acts a default one with end = '\n' internally so 45 is print in next line 
                          print(45)

                          output : hello*hi 
                                   45 


                    7. New line character
                    -------------------------
                             \n 

                          print('hello\nhi')

                          output : 
                          -------- 
                          hello 
                          hi 

                    8. Raw Strings 
                    ------------------ 

                            print('hello/nhi') ==> hello 
                                                   hi 
                            x = 'D:\Python Notes\Python-Notes\2.Python Foundation'

                            print(x) ==> D:\Python Notes\Python-Notes(icon).Python Foundation

                            y = 'E:\Edupoly\Python\new-year-file'

                            print(y) ==>  E:\Edupoly\Python
                                          ew-year-file 
                                       
                                here, python recognises blackslash n which makes to print the text in next line 
                            
                            print('\3') ==> heart shape 
                            print('\4') ==> some other shape 

                             with this we have problems so we need to fix it by using raw strings 

                       by using r infront of the string 

                          print(r'hello\nhi') ==> it prints as whole string ==> hello\nhi
                          print(r'D:\Python Notes\Python-Notes\2.Python Foundation')
                          print(r'E:\Edupoly\Python\new-year-file')

                           The above statements gives the output as a string respectively 
                           so by using r string python treats as a string 

                    9. input() statement for taking user input
                    --------------------------------------------- 

                          input('what is your name ?') 

                          x = input('what is your name ?')
                          print(x)
                          print(type(x))

                        output : 

                               what is your name ? Mutyam 

                               Mutyam 

                               < class 'str' > 

                        Note : whatever we enter in the input it gets converted into a string 

                            x = input('what is your age ?')
                            print(x) 
                            print(type(x))

                        output : 

                                what is your age ? 10
                                10
                                < class 'str' > 


                    10. Type casting user input values
                    --------------------------------------- 


                    We can convert the str into int if you want the age to be int by using explicit typecasting
                    
                        x = int(input('what is your age ?'))
                        print(x)
                        print(type(x))

                       output : 

                              what is your age ? 20 
                              20 
                              < class 'int' >

                        x = float(input('what is the price of an item ? '))
                        print(x) 
                        print(type(x)) 

                        output : 

                                what is the price of an item ? 23.67 
                                23.67
                                < class 'float' >
