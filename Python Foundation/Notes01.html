                => 5. The Assignment Operator(=)
                => 6. Examples of different data like numbers and text 
                => 7. The Print() Function 
                => 8. Printing data in the VS Code terminal using the print() function 
                => 9. Introduction to data types
                => 10. Numeric data types : int , float and complex
                => 11. Sequence data types : str, list and tuple 
                => 12. Mapping Data type : dict 
                => 13. Set Data Types : set and frozen Set
                => 14. Boolean Data type 
                => 15. None data type 
                => 16. The type() function  



                1. Introduction to Varibales and data 
                              
                A variable is a named container for data that can change. 
                Variables are used to store and manipulate data in a program.

                2. Variables as containers to hold the data 
                     x = 10

                3. Different data in our daily life 
                     
                      data in our daily life ==> water , air (air in balloon) etc., 

                4. Storing data in variables
                          
                       x = 'Mutyam'
                       p = 10  
                       y = 2.5
                         
                5. The Assignment Operator(=)
                         
                    Assignment Operator is used for storing a value in a variable

                        x = 'Hello' //here between variable and data we use assignment operator 
                        as to assign the data to the variable 

                6. Examples of different data like numbers and text 
                     ==> numbers

                           23  ==> Integer (int)
                           2.5 ==> Floating point number(float)
                           2 + 7j ==> complex 
                           

                     ==> text or string 

                            "mutyam" ==> String
                            'Bhargav'
                            ''' hello ''' ==> Multi-line comment or docstring
                            """ Hello """
                            "m"  ==> in python single character acts as a string

                7.The Print() Function 
                          
                       print() function is inbuilt function
                       print('Mutyam')

                 
                8. Printing data in the VS Code terminal using the print() function 
                        

                9. Introduction to data types

                      Python offers a variety of data types to store and manipulate different kinds of information 
                      Knowing these types and their specific characteristics is crucial for writing effective and efficient 
                      python code. 

                      Here's a breakdown of the essential datatypes 

                   ** Numeric Types : 

                        ==> int(Integer) : Represents whole numbers of unlimited length, positive or negative
                                           Example : 10, -70, 0

                        ==> float (Floating-point) : Represents floating-point numbers with limited precision(around 15 decimal places)
                                                     Example : 3.14159, 9.81, -2.5

                        ==> complex : Represents complex numbers in the form x + yj , where j is the imaginary unit and x and y are real numbers 
                                                Example : 3 + 2j, 1.5 + 4.7j 

                     
                   ** Sequence Types : 

                        ==> list :  An Ordered, mutable collection of items 
                                    allowing duplicates 
                                    items can be of different data types 
                                    enclosed with square brackets

                             Ex : [1, 'hello', 3.14]
                                  ['apple', 'Banana', 'apple']

                        ==> tuple : An Ordered, immutable collection of items 
                                    items can be of different data types 
                                    Once created, elements can't be changed 
                                    enclosed with parentheses

                             Ex : (1, 'hello', 3.14)
                                  ('orange', 'grape')

                        ==> str (String) : Represents sequence of characters(text). 
                                           Strings are immutable 
                             Ex : 'Hello, World!', "42"

                  ** Mapping Type : 

                         ==> dict(dictionary) :  An unordered collection of key-value pairs. 
                                                 Keys must be unique and immutable (eg : strings, numbers, tuples), 
                                                 while values can be of any datatype. 

                                    Ex : {"name"  : 'Mutyam', "age" : 20}
                                         {"fruit" : 'Apple', "count" : 12}

                  ** Set Types : 
                    
                        ==> Set : An Unordered collection of unique items . 
                                  Items can be of any datatype, but must be hashable (meaning they can be used as dictionary keys)
                                  enclosed with curly brackets

                                  Ex : {1,2,3,4}
                                       {"apple", "banana"}

                        ==> frozen set : An immutable set. Once created, its items cannot be changed. 
                            
                                  Ex : frozenset({1,2,3,4}), frozenset(("a", "b", "c"))

                ** Boolean Type : 

                        ==> bool : Represents Boolean Values : True or False 
                                   Used for logical conditions and comparisons 

                            Ex : True , False 

                ** None Type : 

                        ==> None : Represents the absence of value. 
                                   Often used as a placeholder or to indicate that a variable has no assigned value 

                            Ex : None 

                16. The type() function 
                
                         ==> The type function returns the type of the data passed to it
                             
                             Ex:  type(35)  ==> int 
                                  type(25.45) ==> float 
                                  type('hello') ==> str 
                                  type(True) ==> bool 

                
                       
                Difference between list | tuple | set 

                l = [1,2,3,4]  ==> list is ordered collection of mutable data (can store duplicate values)
                t = (1,2,3,4)  ==> tuple is ordered collection of immutable data (can store duplicate values)
                s = {1,2,3,4}  ==> set is unordered collection of mutable data (cannot store duplicate values).
