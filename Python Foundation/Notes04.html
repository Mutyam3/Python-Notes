                    ==> 

             2. Different flow chart elements 
             --------------------------------- 

                    ==> Oval shape        ==> used for start / end 
                    ==> Rectangle         ==> used for statement 
                    ==> Parallelogram     ==> used for input / output 
                    ==> Rhombus           ==> used for decision / condition 

             3. Using flow charts to build program flow and logic 
             ------------------------------------------------------ 

                 Problem Statement :  Enter the birth of a person and print the age.  

                                 start

                                   ||
                                   \/ 

                            y = Enter Birth year

                                   ||
                                   \/

                             x = 2024 - y 
                                   
                                   ||
                                   \/ 

                                 print(x)

                                   || 
                                   \/ 

                                  stop 

                    year =  int(input('Enter your year of birth ? '))

                    x = 2025 - year 

                    print(x)

                    output : 
                             Enter your year of birth ? 1998 
                             27

             4. Conditions or boolean expressions

                        x = 4 < 5

                        here 4 < 5  is a boolean expression 

                boolean expression is also called as condition 


                Problem Statement : Enter the birth year of a person and if the birth year is more than 1999 print
