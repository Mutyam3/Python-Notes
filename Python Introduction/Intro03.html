              **** 1. The Official Python Webiste ***** 
              ------------------------------------------- 

            ==>  We need Python Interpreter to convert our python code to machine understandable code 
            ==>  For to download Python Interpreter, we need to go to this webiste : python.org/downloads/ 
                  
                    On that Page, you can see Download button with Python - latest version 
                    by clicking on download button, actually we are downloading the python interpreter 
                     you will get exe file after click on that download button 

            ==>  or you can go to microsoft store in ur system by searching microsoft store
                 and Search Python in Microsoft store search bar after searching , you will get the python versions
                 choose your whatever python version you required. 

            ==>  After download you can search python on your system , then you will get the interpreter i.e we open 
                 interpreter as in interactive mode. 
                  its look like command prompt 
                  u can do math operations on the interpreter 
                  like : 10 + 20
                         10 * 200
                         3000/1000
                         x = 10 
                         y = 20
                         z = x + y 
                         z 
                         30 ==> output
                 This interpreter convert our code into machine understandable code line by line 
                 For to check whether our interpreter is working or not u can check like this but 
                 to make application u can do it on interpreter directly as it can save our previous code if we close and open 
                 interpreter we lost the previous code so we don't use this 

            ==> Writing code in Interpreter Vs Writing code in files 

                     if Writing Code in Interpreter , if I close the interpreter the whole code is gone 
                     while wirting code in Files the code will be saved  

            ==> Now a days, we have some softwares on internet which helping us to do all these things in one place, A single software can 
                do all these things a single software can create a file 
                                                                 a folder 
                                                                 rename the file 
                                                                 then write code into the file 
                                                                 and run the code of the file 
                                                                 to give us the output those kind of softwares are known as IDE 
                            [Integregated   Development Environment (IDE's)] 
                        These IDE's are nothing but software they are Code Editors 

            ==> We use Visual Studio Code [IDE]
                         
            ==> To create python file we use .py extension 
                       
                              Ex : Mutyam.py 
                 in that file u can start writing python code 

                 print('hello')

                To run the python file 
                      go to terminal and write py and give space and give the name of the python file 
                      ex :  py Mutyam.py 

                commenting in python 

                #Here, the python code is : 

                print('Mutyam Bhargav Reddy')
                print('Hello World')
