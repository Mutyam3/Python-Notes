                1. Introduction To Programming Languages :

                => 1. Importance of Python programming language 
                => 2. Types of Programming Languages 
                => 3. Compiled and Interpreted Languages 
                => 4. Compiler and Interpreter 
                => 5. Speed Comparison of Compiled and Interpreted Languages 
                => 6. Behavior of interpreted languages like python 
                => 7. The Python Interpreter 



              **** 1. IMPORTANCE OF PYTHON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE **** 
              
              
                => First Reason :  In Python, the syntax is very less
                => Second Reason is : before this , we need to know the types of programming languages and Compiled and Interpreted Langauges 
                                      let's see those points first : 

              **** 2. TYPES OF PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES ****

                =>  C 
                => C++
                => Java 
                => Javascript 
                => Ruby 
                => Go 

                they work in different way or they give output in different way 

              **** 3. COMPILED AND INTERPRETED LANGUAGES 

               ----------------------                                                        -----------------------
              |                      |                                                      |                       | 
              |                      |                 ---------------                      |                       |
              |    print('Mutyam')   |                 |              |                     |      01010101010      |

              |    y = 20            |                 |              |                     |                       |
              |    z = x + y         |                 ---------------                      |       01010101010     |
              |                      |                    software                          |                       |
              |                      |                  [middlepart]                        |                       |
              -----------------------                                                       |------------------------
                    [source code]                 [ This software will convert
                                                      code to machine code ]
                                                        [compiler]
              The above kind of code in 
              any language(python, java, javascript)
              here the code is written by us typing 
              from key board but our system cannot 
              understand this code 
              The system only understand 0's and 1's 
              processors runs the code so we need 
              some software to run the human code to 
              machine understandable code 

               COMPILED LANGUAGE [java, c,c++, csharp]
              Every code is converted into machine understandable code 
              Now the difference with these two types of languages (compiled and interpreter) comes in this middlepart what is happening here 
              For example, the software will take the whole file [code] i.e we pass the whole file to the software 
              The software will convert this code into 0's and 1's (machine understandable code) line by line. 
              [ first it will take first line and convert it and goes to second line convert it ..so on ]
              After converting it will create a new file , in that file 0's and 1's will be there 
              After creating a new file ,it will pass the file to our system i.e our processor 
              our processor will get the whole file where all the 0's and 1's and then now our system executing our code 
              This is one of the type of working where this type of working is happening that type of language is called Compiled language

              |                      |                    software                          |                       |
              |                      |                  [middlepart]                        |                       |
              -----------------------                                                       |------------------------
                    [source code]                 [ This software will convert
                                                      code to machine code ]
                                                        [Interpreter]

              INTERPRETER LANGUAGE [python, javascript]


              Another type of language is interpreter langauge lets see how it works :
              
              here the first line of source code will be converted to machine understandable code and then that one line 
              is given to the system not the whole file that first line will get executed by the interpreter then 
              second line will be given and so on 

              So what is the difference here by seeing the process we can understand but how does it effect the language 

              In Compile language, the compiler is converting the whole code into machine understandable code if there are four lines 
              it is okay to convert those four lines it will take just one second or may be it takes less one Second but if I have 
              7000 lines of code is there, to convert those 7000 lines of code into machine underdtandable code it takes 2 to three minutes 
              so our system waits for two to three seconds until the whole code is getting converted into 0's and 1's 
              KEEP NOTE : after converting 0's and 1's only the compiler gives to the system as a file with 1's and 0's 
              so here the system should wait for compilation to get completed

              In Interpreter Language, the Interpreter is not converting the whole file at a time , so to convert one line it will 
              not take 5 seconds right it will be very like milliseconds so it will take one line and give it to the system so the system is 
              ready system will get the first line it will execute then it will go to next line and execute the second line 
              Executes faster in this manner so here system should not wait for long minutes 


             Speed Comparison of Compiled and Interpreted Languages 
             
             [source code to machine understandable code]
             Compiled language takes more time to compile and 
             Interpreter langauge takes less time to transpile / interpret 

             Running of the code [execution]

             Compiled Language takes less time to execute 
             Interpreter Language takes more time to execute 

             PYHTON IS A INTERPRETER LANGUAGE 
              The second reason is it takes less time to transpile / interpret but it takes more tme to execute 

              So that is the importance of python langauge 

              [

                Compiled Language (java , c, c++, csharp)

                In compiled language, compilation time is more
                In compiled language, execution time is less 

                Interpreted Language (Python, Javascript)

                In Interpreted Language, compilation time is less
                In Interpreted Language, execution time is more 
              
              ]

                 
            The Python Interpreter : 

            Here, the Python Interpreter is a software which we need to convert that source code into machine understandable code 
            this software can download from the internet and that software will be used by us to convert source code into machine understandable code 

            We discuss how to download this Python Interpreter in next section
